Some tools for Stars Without Number, basically an excuse to learn to javascript

The tool is based around the Stars Without Number. A copy of the rulebook can be found [here](https://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1366/05/1366053319764.pdf)

The page only runs locally at present. You will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm), then in the containing folder, run ```npm run build```, then open the webpage.
